# Usage:

This package is on MELPA. For simple installation, `M-x package-install` and then `lusty-explorer`. To install manually, copy `lusty-explorer.el` somewhere in your `load-path` along with [`s.el`](https://github.com/magnars/s.el). Add this line to your `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```elisp
(require 'lusty-explorer)
```

To launch the explorer, run or bind the following commands:

```
M-x lusty-file-explorer
M-x lusty-buffer-explorer
```

And then use as you would `find-file` or `switch-to-buffer`. A split window shows the `*Lusty-Matches*` buffer, which updates dynamically as you type using a fuzzy matching algorithm.  One match is highlighted; you can move the highlight using `C-n` / `C-p` (next, previous) and `C-f` / `C-b` (next column, previous column).  Pressing `TAB` or `RET` will select the highlighted match (with slightly different semantics).

To create a new buffer with the given name, press `C-x e`.  To open dired at the current viewed directory, press `C-x d`.

# Customization:

To modify the keybindings, use something like:

```elisp
(add-hook 'lusty-setup-hook 'my-lusty-hook)
(defun my-lusty-hook ()
  (define-key lusty-mode-map "\C-j" 'lusty-highlight-next))
```

Respects these variables:

```elisp
completion-ignored-extensions
```
