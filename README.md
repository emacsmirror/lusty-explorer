# Usage:

To install, copy this file somewhere in your `load-path` and add this line to your `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```elisp
(require 'lusty-explorer)
```

To launch the explorer, run or bind the following commands:

```
M-x lusty-file-explorer
M-x lusty-buffer-explorer
```

And then use as you would `find-file` or `switch-to-buffer`. A split window shows the `*Lusty-Matches*` buffer, which updates dynamically as you type using a fuzzy matching algorithm.  One match is highlighted; you can move the highlight using `C-n` / `C-p` (next, previous) and `C-f` / `C-b` (next column, previous column).  Pressing `TAB` or `RET` will select the highlighted match (with slightly different semantics).

To create a new buffer with the given name, press `C-x e`.  To open dired at the current viewed directory, press `C-x d`.

Note: `lusty-explorer.el` benefits greatly from byte-compilation.  To byte-compile this library:

```
$ emacs -Q -batch -f batch-byte-compile lusty-explorer.el
```

(You can also do this from within Emacs, but it's best done in a clean
session.)  Then, restart Emacs or M-x load-library and choose the newly
generated lusty-explorer.elc file.

# Customization:

To modify the keybindings, use something like:

```elisp
(add-hook 'lusty-setup-hook 'my-lusty-hook)
(defun my-lusty-hook ()
  (define-key lusty-mode-map "\C-j" 'lusty-highlight-next))
```

Respects these variables:

```elisp
completion-ignored-extensions
```
